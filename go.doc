package stringpool // import "github.com/skeptycal/stringpool"

Package stringpool provides a sync.Pool of efficient strings.Builder workers
that may be reused as needed, reducing the need to instantiate and allocate
new builders in text heavy applications.

From the Go standard library:

A Builder is used to efficiently build a string using Write methods. It
minimizes memory copying.

A Pool is used to cache allocated but unused items for later reuse,
relieving pressure on the sgarbage collector. That is, it makes it easy to
build efficient, thread-safe free lists.

Go 1.10 or later is required.

func Example()
func Get() *strings.Builder
func Release(b *strings.Builder)
type StringPool struct{ ... }
    func New() *StringPool
